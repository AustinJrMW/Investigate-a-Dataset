# Investigate-a-Dataset

A project I completed and submitted for the Udacity Data Analytics Course

I used a dataset with information for 110.527 medical appointments and its 14 associated variables (characteristics). 
The most important one if the patient show-up or no-show to the appointment. Variable names are self-explanatory.

Social welfare program of the Government of Brazil, is represented by scholarship. You can find more info on it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia
